Final project:
Workers produce datasets for researchers as part of this study. They start by going over the criteria for the dataset and using IoT devices to gather the required data. AI is then used to assess the quality of the gathered data. After validation, the researcher receives the dataset, and employees receive safe blockchain-based payment compensation.
